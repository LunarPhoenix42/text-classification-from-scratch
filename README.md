Text-Classification-With-Keras-on-IEMOCAP
Introduction
Text classification is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involving the assignment of predefined categories to text segments. In this project, we focus on building a text classification model from scratch using the IEMOCAP (Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture) dataset. The goal is to classify text data based on its emotional content, providing insights into how deep learning models can understand and interpret human emotions.

The IEMOCAP dataset is well-known for its richness in emotional annotations, making it an ideal candidate for emotion recognition tasks. Using the Keras framework, we walk through the entire process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, showcasing how to implement a text classification system from the ground up.
